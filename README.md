# Game-of-Life
This HTML file contains an in pure JS implementation of the Game of Life.
I did not comment the code in this case, because is simple to understand. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

## How to use it
You can run it by downloading and open the HTML file in your favorite browser (IE could possibly have problems).
If you hover the upper arrow, a menu will appear (see right). In this menu you can change the size of the field, the number of living cells and the speed.
